AngularJS productivity tool: pomodoro style timer + todo list

The Basics
----------
The app consists of two independent timers: an incremental one used as a work timer and a 5 minute decremental one used as a rest timer.
New tasks are added to the todo list using the text box. New task panels can be marked complete using the checkmark and can be deleted using the x.

The topmost non-completed task is considered the primary task (and this is reflected using the color). The primary task will record the amount of time it has been active, as long as the top work timer is running.

Things I would still like to do
-------------------------------
- Allow changing of the rest timer starting point
- Allow editing of the text of the todo items
- Add HTML5 desktop notifications
- Change the color scheme from blue-based to red-based
